# Learn SQL
This is a repository for anyone who wants to learn SQL.<br/>
It's an effort by <a href="https://github.com/yashpathack">Yash</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yashpathack">Aniruddha</a> to understand and learn <b>"SQL"</b>.<br/>
SQL, is an International Organization for Standardization (ISO)-governed standard language that is used for database programming.<br/>
You can use all the queries laid down in this tutorial in the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all">SQL Tryit Editor</a> by <b>W3Schools</b>.<br/><br/>

We're using the Northwind sample database provided by https://www.w3schools.com/<br/>
You can also practice on Oracle's Offical website dedicated entirely to SQL from
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/application-development/livesql/livesql-2715848.html">Live SQL</a><br/>
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">On some points of the tutorial <b>Oracle</b> or <b>PL/SQL</b> Clauses and Fucntions are used. So you can download <b>Oracle Express Edition 11g</b> which does not require any connection with SQL Server Client and is made for the use of developers and learners, from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/downloads/index.html">here</a> or else there is an online interpreter provided by <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html5/">TutorialsPoint</a> with online <b>Oracle XE 11.2.0-1.0</b> all built in, which include some basic tables, you can use to practice on, from <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/oracle_terminal_online.php">here</a>. The Tables that I found were DEPT, EMP, DUAL, SYSTEM_PRIVILEGE_MAP, TABLE_PRIVILEGE_MAP, STMT_AUDIT_OPTION_MAP, AUDIT_ACTIONS.</span><br/>
After the Introduction of DataBase it is adviced to use either <b>Live SQL</b> or <b>Oracle.</b><br/><br/>
The below picture is <i>one</i> of the table of database, the "Customer" table. There are many more tables available.<br/>
